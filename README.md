# KNN_Manual_vs_ScikitLearn

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Manual vs scikit-learn Implementation \
This project demonstrates a complete, step-by-step walkthrough of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for regression tasks. \
It includes both a manual implementation from scratch and a scikit-learn based approach, highlighting how KNN works under the hood and how to optimize it for real-world use.

Key Topics Covered:

- Manual KNN implementation: distance calculation, sorting, neighbor selection, and prediction.

- Proper handling of feature scaling to ensure fair distance measurements.

- How to deal with categorical variables in KNN and dangers of high-cardinality features.

- Discussion of when KNN is a good choice and cases where it can outperform linear regression.

Objective:
To provide a clear, educational comparison between manual KNN and library-based KNN, building intuition for when and how to apply KNN effectively.
